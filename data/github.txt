PROFILE OVERVIEW
I am an AI and Machine Learning Engineer with experience in building intelligent systems,
web-based AI applications, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.
My GitHub repositories focus on real-world AI projects using Python, Flask, FastAPI,
LangChain, and deep learning frameworks.

KEY PROJECTS

1. RAG Teacher’s AI Assistant
Repository: RAG-Teacher-s-Ai-Assistant
Link: https://github.com/Ekrashzahid123/RAG-Teacher-s-Ai-Assistant

Description:
Built an AI-powered Teacher Assistant chatbot using LangChain and FastAPI.
The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to analyze
student performance data and provide personalized learning insights.
Implemented vector search for context-aware responses and deployed the system
as REST APIs.

Technologies:
Python, LangChain, FastAPI, FAISS, Vector Databases, LLMs

--------------------------------------------------

2. AI Image Classification System with Flask
Repository: AI-Image-classification-system-With-flask
Link: https://github.com/Ekrashzahid123/AI-Image-classification-system-With-flask

Description:
Developed a full-stack AI image classification web application using Flask.
Users can upload images and receive real-time predictions generated by a
trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Implemented backend APIs, model inference, and user authentication.

Technologies:
Python, Flask, TensorFlow, CNN, HTML, CSS

--------------------------------------------------

3. Object Detection Flask Project
Repository: object_detection_flask-project
Link: https://github.com/Ekrashzahid123/object_detection_flask-project

Description:
Created a real-time object detection web application using Flask and
TensorFlow.js COCO-SSD model.
The application detects common objects such as people, cars, and bottles
directly in the browser.

Technologies:
Python, Flask, TensorFlow.js, COCO-SSD, JavaScript
